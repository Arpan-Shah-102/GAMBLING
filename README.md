# GAMBLING
### Gambling with Python 3.12
A 'small' project I made because I was bored in school. <br/>
NOTE: Poker does NOT work in any of the versions because idk how to do them. <br/>
<br/>
V1: Uses the terminal <br/>
V2 (not done): Would've used a Raspberry Pi <br/>
V3: Uses Tkinter for GUI <br/>
V4 (not done): Would've used PyQt5 <br/>
V5 (not done): Would've used Pygame <br/>
V6: Uses HTML, CSS, & JS to make web versions <br/>
(only slot machine kinda works in V6)
